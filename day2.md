# Learning Journal Day 2

Today we learned about arrays, if/else conditionals and we are now pros at ACP-ing. We were going to go over more CSS but we are moving it to tomorrow. I had some difficulty wrapping my head around parsleInt but I think i've got it figured out now. I'm excited to keep building on these newfound tricks. 

Being in a class environment really helps with understanding these concepts.
