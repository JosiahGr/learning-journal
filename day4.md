Day 4 learning journal

Today we covered a little bit of all three. We learned about images and links for HTML, a lot about fixed, absolute, and relative positioning in CSS and we also started using functions in our first ever pair programming. It was a little dificult to get things up and running but when we were both used to our rolls it was really nice! It's great having two minds attacking one problem. 

After code review this morning I was able to grasp while and for loops a little better. It felt overwhelming when I first tried but once I saw some more examples of what went right (and wrong) in other codes it all made sense to me! Peter was a big help too! I'm still not great at them but it's the first step. It's definitely something i'll be focusing on over the weekend. 

My project is finally up to date, well, it's not broken. So that feels pretty good.
