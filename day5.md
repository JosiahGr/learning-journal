Today in class we learned a bit more about GitHub and how it stores our files. For our lab assignment we needed to create branches and utilize them, which felt pretty straight forward to me. We also learned more about CSS and how to color and position things, in Javascript we covered more on functions. 

In lab today we were supposed to make math solving functions without the use of + or * in them. I didn't see the point in that but by the time I actually figured out HOW to do it, I felt like I truly understood functions and how they work. So I get it now. ;) I kept trying to go the route of a for loop, which I've been struggling with lately, and although I didn't actually use any I feel like I have fully wrapped my head around that as well. I was prepared to throw my computer out the window yesterday as I left CodeFellows, but as I was riding home on the bus I was able to think through my problem instead of just finding small fixes and I figured out the approach I was supposed to take. 

Now it's the weekend and I can finally catch up on actually writing those assignments for our reading!
